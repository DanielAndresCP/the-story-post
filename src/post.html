                        Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill,
                        only a few miles from her house. The car had been
                        hastily packed and Marta was inside trying to round
                        up the last of the pets. Dave went through his
                        mental list of the most important papers and documents
                        that they couldn't leave behind. He scolded
                        himself for not having prepared these better in
                        advance and hoped that he had remembered everything
                        that was needed. He continued to wait for Marta to
                        appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere
                        to be seen.
